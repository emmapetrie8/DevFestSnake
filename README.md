# DevFestSnake
DevFest Scotland PyGame workshop 25/11/2023

## Getting started
In order to run the snake.py script, PyGame module must be installed.

'pip install pygame'

## Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the Pygame library in Python. The game involves controlling a snake on a window, eating fruits to grow longer, and avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.

## How to Play

* Use the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to control the snake's direction.
* The snake will grow longer each time it eats a fruit.
* Avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.
* The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
* Your score is displayed on the screen.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
Pygame library
